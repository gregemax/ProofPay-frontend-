### ProofPay

Agreement → Proof → Payment → Accountability

ProofPay is a peer-to-peer payment layer that adds context, intent, and protection to money transfers. Instead of sending money blindly, ProofPay ensures every payment is backed by an agreement, supporting proof, and a clear accountability trail.

## The Problem

Most P2P payment apps are built for speed, not safety.

Once money is sent:

There is little to no context about why it was sent

Payments are often irreversible

Disputes lack evidence and structure

Scams and misunderstandings are common

Payments record that money moved, but not what was agreed upon.

The Solution

ProofPay transforms a simple transfer into a trusted transaction by enforcing a structured flow:

Agreement → Proof → Payment → Accountability

Money is no longer sent without memory, intent, or protection.

Key Features
## 1. Payment Agreements

Create a structured agreement before sending money:

Purpose (rent, service, purchase, loan, etc.)

Amount and deadline

Optional conditions or notes

## 2. Proof & Evidence

Attach supporting materials to each payment:

Invoices

Documents

Images

Screenshots or confirmations

This creates a shared, verifiable record for both parties.

## 3. Intent Verification

Before funds are sent, ProofPay verifies intent by:

Clearly summarizing the agreement

Confirming recipient identity

Warning users about irreversible or high-risk transfers

## 4. Escrow (Optional)

For higher-risk payments:

Funds can be held securely

Released upon confirmation, deadline, or agreement fulfillment

## 5. Dispute Resolution

If a dispute occurs:

Both parties reference the same agreement and proof

Evidence is already attached

Resolution is faster, clearer, and fairer
